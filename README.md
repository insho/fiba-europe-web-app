# Fiba Basketball Machine Learning - React Web App
Web app with vizualizations and insights related to my [Fiba Basketball Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project).


## The Project:

Create a web app to both visualize and better explain my Fiba basketball machine learning project. Besides a nice companion to the machine learning project, it was an excellent opportunity to gain some experience building and deploying a react web app for the first time.

The machine learning project itself can be [found here](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project). 

It involved four main parts:

1. **[Acquiring the Data](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/blob/master/fiba_part1_acquiring_data.ipynb)**
2. **[Processing the Data](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/blob/master/fiba_part2_process_data.ipynb)**
3. **[Finding Additional Metadata](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/blob/master/fiba_part3_finding_additional_metadata.ipynb)**
4. **[Creating, Testing and Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/blob/master/fiba_part4_making_algs.ipynb)**


**Extra SQL DEMO:** 

I've also included a 'sql demo' notebook showcasing some sql-based analysis and (somewhat) complicated querying of the fiba europe files. 

I've found the best option is to [launch the notebook in Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/master?filepath=fiba_europe_sql_demo.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/insho/fiba-europe-basketball-project/master?filepath=fiba_europe_sql_demo.ipynb).
